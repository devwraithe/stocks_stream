# Stock Stream

Stock Stream is a mock mobile application to show data from the stock market. Built using Dart and Flutter with RiverPod for state management and I manually created the JSON file for the stock data so I can manipulate the data whenever it's necessary. The architecture is a combination of Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture and Model View ViewModel.
